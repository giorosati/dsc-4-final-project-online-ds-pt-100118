# Module 4 Final Project

This repo is for my Flatiron Data Science program, this being the machine learning project. 
I developed this notebook to enter the Kaggle competition in August 2019 titled "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection".

The source data can be obtained at Kaggle:

Jupyter notebook: student_v3.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook utilizes Keras packages to create a convolutional neural network that classifies fundus images of retinas into the 5 classes of diabetic retinopathy.
